# COMBINING-COMSOL-MATLAB-PYTHON-FOR-SIMULATION
When we need optimize the input or parameter of some model, eg. the phase of input light field, 
different software are necessary. 
COMSOL, fit for solving the equation of the model
PYTHON, has lots of package for optimizing algorithm
However, the two COMSOL doesn't have a LiveLink for Python, So, we use MATLAB to conbine the two software together.
